# Automated genesis config generation

Run `./build.sh` after modifying the env with appropiate values.

The output contains:

- `genesis.json`, `app.toml`, `config.toml`, `node_key.json`, `priv_validator_key.json`. These files should be moved to `~/.threefold_hub/config` on which the node will run after doing `threefold_hubd init test-node --chain-id $CHAIN_ID`.
- `gbt-config.toml` should be moved to `~/.gbt/config.toml` after doing `gbt init`.
- `threefold_hubd` binary

To run a node: `DAEMON_HOME=/root/.threefold_hub DAEMON_NAME=threefold_hubd DAEMON_ALLOW_DOWNLOAD_BINARIES=true cosmovisor start`.

The cosmovisor version used is `v1.0.0`. installed using `go install github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/cosmovisor/cmd/cosmovisor@v1.0.0`.

It's required to have `~/.threefold_hub/cosmovisor/genesis/bin/threefold_hubd` as the threefold_hubd binary before starting cosmovisor.

For info about how to serve the frontend: `https://github.com/threefoldtech/threefold_hub/tree/development/frontend#production-serving`. The frontend/public/config.js must be modified to match the deployed endpoints and addresses. The endpoint listening address are :1317 and :26657 by default as defined in `app.toml` and `config.toml` file.
